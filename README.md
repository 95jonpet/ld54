# Tetrominated

Is Tetris too easy? This game surely isn't.

Tetrominated is Tetris on a 20x20 grid with a sliding 10x20 window.
The entire line must be filled!
In order to compensate for the added difficulty, explosive tetrominoes have added to occasionally free some well-needed space from the board.
